Some notes on setup
-------------------
If you're importing the project to eclipse - 
Add the following Extenral jars:  
* android.jar  
* uiautomator.jar
(These can be found in $ANDROID_HOME/platforms/android-17/)_

You'll also want to add BOTH the Junit3 & Junit4 libaries - the unit tests under 'test' use JUnit4
the main driver depends on JUnit3.
